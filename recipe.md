First, in a large bowl mix together 1.5 teaspoons instant yeast and Â½ teaspoon of sugar.

Usually instant yeast can be mixed directly in the flour or in water at room temperature.
But I am detailing this method as it can be implemented if you are using dry active yeast.
Add 2 teaspoons dry active yeast for this pizza crust recipe.
Add 1 cup of lukewarm water (44 degrees Celsius) and stir. Set aside and let the yeast activate.
You should start to see the yeast mixture bubbling up and doubling in size after about 10 to 15 minutes.
