First, in a large bowl mix together 1.5 teaspoons instant yeast and Â½ teaspoon of sugar.

Usually instant yeast can be mixed directly in the flour or in water at room temperature.
But I am detailing this method as it can be implemented if you are using dry active yeast.
Add 2 teaspoons dry active yeast for this pizza crust recipe.
